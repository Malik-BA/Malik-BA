# Malik — ICT Business Analyst

I'm a BA focused on translating complex business requirements into clear, actionable technical requirements.

I work at the intersection of business, systems, and technology—collaborating and liaising with stakeholders, developers, and architects to align solutions with business outcomes and deliver them efficiently.

I've created this profile to showcase my thought process in requirements analysis, system thinking, and documentation in Agile & technical environments.
